    Add one
    or more block devices before the Packer build starts. If you add instance
    store volumes or EBS volumes in addition to the root device volume, the
    created AMI will contain block device mapping information for those
    volumes. Amazon creates snapshots of the source instance's root volume and
    any other EBS volumes described here. When you launch an instance from this
    new AMI, the instance automatically launches with these additional volumes,
    and will restore them from snapshots taken from the source instance.
