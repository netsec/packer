required: []
not_required:
- name: disk_size
  type: uint
  docs: |
    The size, in megabytes, of the hard disk to create
    for the VM. By default, this is 40000 (about 40 GB).
- name: disk_type
  type: string
  docs: |
    The type for image file based virtual disk drives,
    defaults to expand. Valid options are expand (expanding disk) that the
    image file is small initially and grows in size as you add data to it, and
    plain (plain disk) that the image file has a fixed size from the moment it
    is created (i.e the space is allocated for the full drive). Plain disks
    perform faster than expanding disks. skip_compaction will be set to true
    automatically for plain disks.
- name: guest_os_type
  type: string
  docs: |
    The guest OS type being installed. By default
    this is "other", but you can get dramatic performance improvements by
    setting this to the proper value. To view all available values for this run
    prlctl create x --distribution list. Setting the correct value hints to
    Parallels Desktop how to optimize the virtual hardware to work best with
    that operating system.
- name: hard_drive_interface
  type: string
  docs: |
    The type of controller that the hard
    drives are attached to, defaults to "sata". Valid options are "sata", "ide",
    and "scsi".
- name: host_interfaces
  type: '[]string'
  docs: |
    A list of which interfaces on the
    host should be searched for a IP address. The first IP address found on one
    of these will be used as {{ .HTTPIP }} in the boot_command. Defaults to
    ["en0", "en1", "en2", "en3", "en4", "en5", "en6", "en7", "en8", "en9",
    "ppp0", "ppp1", "ppp2"].
- name: skip_compaction
  type: bool
  docs: |
    Virtual disk image is compacted at the end of
    the build process using prl_disk_tool utility (except for the case that
    disk_type is set to plain). In certain rare cases, this might corrupt
    the resulting disk image. If you find this to be the case, you can disable
    compaction using this configuration value.
- name: vm_name
  type: string
  docs: |
    This is the name of the PVM directory for the new
    virtual machine, without the file extension. By default this is
    "packer-BUILDNAME", where "BUILDNAME" is the name of the build.
