source_path: builder/vagrant/builder.go
name: Config
required:
- name: source_path
  type: string
  docs: |
    URL of the vagrant box to use, or the name of the
    vagrant box. hashicorp/precise64, ./mylocalbox.box and
    https://example.com/my-box.box are all valid source boxes. If your
    source is a .box file, whether locally or from a URL like the latter example
    above, you will also need to provide a box_name. This option is required,
    unless you set global_id. You may only set one or the other, not both.
- name: global_id
  type: string
  docs: |
    the global id of a Vagrant box already added to Vagrant
    on your system. You can find the global id of your Vagrant boxes using the
    command vagrant global-status; your global_id will be a 7-digit number and
    letter comination that you'll find in the leftmost column of the
    global-status output.  If you choose to use global_id instead of
    source_box, Packer will skip the Vagrant initialize and add steps, and
    simply launch the box directly using the global id.
not_required:
- name: output_dir
  type: string
  docs: |
    The directory to create that will contain
    your output box. We always create this directory and run from inside of it to
    prevent Vagrant init collisions. If unset, it will be set to packer- plus
    your buildname.
- name: checksum
  type: string
  docs: |
    The checksum for the .box file. The type of the
    checksum is specified with checksum_type, documented below.
- name: checksum_type
  type: string
  docs: |
    The type of the checksum specified in checksum.
    Valid values are none, md5, sha1, sha256, or sha512. Although the
    checksum will not be verified when checksum_type is set to "none", this is
    not recommended since OVA files can be very large and corruption does happen
    from time to time.
- name: box_name
  type: string
  docs: |
    if your source_box is a boxfile that we need to add
    to Vagrant, this is the name to give it. If left blank, will default to
    "packer_" plus your buildname.
- name: provider
  type: string
  docs: |
    The vagrant provider.
    This parameter is required when source_path have more than one provider,
    or when using vagrant-cloud post-processor. Defaults to unset.
- name: communicator
  type: string
  docs: Communicator
- name: vagrantfile_template
  type: string
  docs: |
    What vagrantfile to use
- name: teardown_method
  type: string
  docs: |
    Whether to halt, suspend, or destroy the box when
    the build has completed. Defaults to "halt"
- name: box_version
  type: string
  docs: |
    What box version to use when initializing Vagrant.
- name: template
  type: string
  docs: |
    a path to a golang template for a
    vagrantfile. Our default template can be found
    here. So far the only template variables available to you are {{ .BoxName }} and
    {{ .SyncedFolder }}, which correspond to the Packer options box_name and
    synced_folder.
- name: synced_folder
  type: string
  docs: Synced Folder
- name: skip_add
  type: bool
  docs: |
    Don't call "vagrant add" to add the box to your local
    environment; this is necessary if you want to launch a box that is already
    added to your vagrant environment.
- name: add_cacert
  type: string
  docs: |
    Equivalent to setting the
    --cacert
    option in vagrant add; defaults to unset.
- name: add_capath
  type: string
  docs: |
    Equivalent to setting the
    --capath option
    in vagrant add; defaults to unset.
- name: add_cert
  type: string
  docs: |
    Equivalent to setting the
    --cert option in
    vagrant add; defaults to unset.
- name: add_clean
  type: bool
  docs: |
    Equivalent to setting the
    --clean flag in
    vagrant add; defaults to unset.
- name: add_force
  type: bool
  docs: |
    Equivalent to setting the
    --force flag in
    vagrant add; defaults to unset.
- name: add_insecure
  type: bool
  docs: |
    Equivalent to setting the
    --insecure flag in
    vagrant add; defaults to unset.
- name: skip_package
  type: bool
  docs: |
    if true, Packer will not call vagrant package to
    package your base box into its own standalone .box file.
- name: output_vagrantfile
  type: string
  docs: Output Vagrantfile
- name: package_include
  type: '&{%!s(token.Pos=5716) <nil> string}'
