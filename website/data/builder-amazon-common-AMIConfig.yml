source_path: builder/amazon/common/ami_config.go
name: AMIConfig
required:
- name: ami_name
  type: string
  docs: |
    The name of the resulting AMI that will appear when
    managing AMIs in the AWS console or via APIs. This must be unique. To help
    make this unique, use a function like timestamp (see template
    engine for more info).
not_required:
- name: ami_description
  type: string
  docs: |
    The description to set for the resulting
    AMI(s). By default this description is empty. This is a template
    engine, see Build template
    data for more information.
- name: ami_virtualization_type
  type: string
  docs: |
    The type of virtualization for the AMI
    you are building. This option is required to register HVM images. Can be
    paravirtual (default) or hvm.
- name: ami_users
  type: '[]string'
  docs: |
    A list of account IDs that have access to
    launch the resulting AMI(s). By default no additional users other than the
    user creating the AMI has permissions to launch it.
- name: ami_groups
  type: '[]string'
  docs: |
    A list of groups that have access to
    launch the resulting AMI(s). By default no groups have permission to launch
    the AMI. all will make the AMI publicly accessible.
- name: ami_product_codes
  type: '[]string'
  docs: |
    A list of product codes to
    associate with the AMI. By default no product codes are associated with the
    AMI.
- name: ami_regions
  type: '[]string'
  docs: |
    A list of regions to copy the AMI to.
    Tags and attributes are copied along with the AMI. AMI copying takes time
    depending on the size of the AMI, but will generally take many minutes.
- name: skip_region_validation
  type: bool
  docs: |
    Set to true if you want to skip
    validation of the ami_regions configuration option. Default false.
- name: tags
  type: TagMap
  docs: |
    Tags applied to the AMI. This is a
    template engine, see Build template
    data for more information.
- name: ena_support
  type: '*bool'
  docs: |
    Enable enhanced networking (ENA but not
    SriovNetSupport) on HVM-compatible AMIs. If set, add
    ec2:ModifyInstanceAttribute to your AWS IAM policy. If false, this will
    disable enhanced networking in the final AMI as opposed to passing the
    setting through unchanged from the source. Note: you must make sure
    enhanced networking is enabled on your instance. See Amazon's
    documentation on enabling enhanced
    networking.
- name: sriov_support
  type: bool
  docs: |
    Enable enhanced networking (SriovNetSupport but
    not ENA) on HVM-compatible AMIs. If true, add
    ec2:ModifyInstanceAttribute to your AWS IAM policy. Note: you must make
    sure enhanced networking is enabled on your instance. See Amazon's
    documentation on enabling enhanced
    networking.
    Default false.
- name: force_deregister
  type: bool
  docs: |
    Force Packer to first deregister an existing
    AMI if one with the same name already exists. Default false.
- name: force_delete_snapshot
  type: bool
  docs: |
    Force Packer to delete snapshots
    associated with AMIs, which have been deregistered by force_deregister.
    Default false.
- name: encrypt_boot
  type: '*bool'
  docs: |
    Whether or not to encrypt the resulting AMI when
    copying a provisioned instance to an AMI. By default, Packer will keep the
    encryption setting to what it was in the source image. Setting false will
    result in an unencrypted image, and true will result in an encrypted one.
- name: kms_key_id
  type: string
  docs: |
    ID, alias or ARN of the KMS key to use for boot
    volume encryption. This only applies to the main region, other regions
    where the AMI will be copied will be encrypted by the default EBS KMS key.
    For valid formats see KmsKeyId in the AWS API docs -
    CopyImage.
    This field is validated by Packer, when using an alias, you will have to
    prefix kms_key_id with alias/.
- name: region_kms_key_ids
  type: map[string]string
  docs: |
    a map of regions to copy the ami
    to, along with the custom kms key id (alias or arn) to use for encryption
    for that region. Keys must match the regions provided in ami_regions. If
    you just want to encrypt using a default ID, you can stick with
    kms_key_id and ami_regions. If you want a region to be encrypted with
    that region's default key ID, you can use an empty string "" instead of a
    key id in this map. (e.g. "us-east-1": "") However, you cannot use
    default key IDs if you are using this in conjunction with snapshot_users
    -- in that situation you must use custom keys. For valid formats see
    KmsKeyId in the AWS API docs -
    CopyImage.
- name: snapshot_tags
  type: TagMap
  docs: |
    Tags to apply to snapshot.
    They will override AMI tags if already applied to snapshot. This is a
    template engine, see Build template
    data for more information.
- name: snapshot_users
  type: '[]string'
  docs: |
    A list of account IDs that have
    access to create volumes from the snapshot(s). By default no additional
    users other than the user creating the AMI has permissions to create
    volumes from the backing snapshot(s).
- name: snapshot_groups
  type: '[]string'
  docs: |
    A list of groups that have access to
    create volumes from the snapshot(s). By default no groups have permission
    to create volumes from the snapshot(s). all will make the snapshot
    publicly accessible.
