    Custom prlctl commands to execute
    in order to further customize the virtual machine being created. The value
    of this is an array of commands to execute. The commands are executed in the
    order defined in the template. For each command, the command is defined
    itself as an array of strings, where each string represents a single
    argument on the command-line to prlctl (but excluding prlctl itself).
    Each arg is treated as a configuration
    template, where the Name
    variable is replaced with the VM name. More details on how to use prlctl
    are below.
