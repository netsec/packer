    This is the path to the directory where the
    resulting virtual machine will be created. This may be relative or absolute.
    If relative, the path is relative to the working directory when packer
    is executed. This directory must not exist or be empty prior to running
    the builder. By default this is output-BUILDNAME where "BUILDNAME" is the
    name of the build.
